## Lyrics Context
(Final Fade Out)

## Visual Ideas
- **04:41 - Final Conflict Sequence:** As the music kicks back in, the scene moves into a series of quick, intense cuts showing various future conflicts:
    - **Soldiers vs. Tripods:** Soldiers firing weapons at Tripod Walkers, which retaliate with invisible heat rays.
    - **The Great Beast:** A giant, ox-like mechanical creature the size of a stadium looms vaguely in the distance, its menacing eyes glowing through the smog.
    - **The Siege:** The high-tech desert base is attacked by faceless, witch-like humanoids in shaggy, disintegrating clothing—appearing as if they have just formed and are physically unstable.
    - **The Vortex:** A specific shot of soldiers firing at these witch figures in a narrow passage. One figure falls, then poses on the ground, generating an electromagnetic vortex that deflects all incoming fire. It holds this position until a flood of other figures overwhelms the soldiers.
- **Final Shot:** A serene view from Earth. The sky has cleared enough to reveal the Moon fragments scattered across the horizon and sky. 
- **Ending:** Title text "**Forgotten Future**" and project information are displayed over this final serene shot to end the teaser.
