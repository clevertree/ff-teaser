## Lyrics Context
(Final Fade Out)

## Visual Ideas
- **04:41 - Final Conflict Sequence:** As the music kicks back in, we witness the **Reclamation of Cradle Zero** (Year 13 AT):
    - **The Pillar of Fire:** A wide shot of the **Desert Base (Cradle Zero)**, dominated by a massive, sky-reaching pillar of heat and energy.
    - **The Vanguard:** **Reset Ajax** and **Reset Rahu** leading a phalanx of **Metal Vessels**. Rahu is framed by the camera as a "Heroic Martyr," his silhouette noble against the flames—reflecting the **Thousand-Year Fallacy** narrative.
    - **The Maya Manifestation:** Suddenly, an unstable anomaly—**The Witch (Maya)**—erupts from the Synodic dust. It is shaggy, flickering, and composed of Water, Fire, Wood, and Metal. It generates an EMP that melts the Archivist projectiles, presenting as an "Evil" force that justifies the Archivists' heavy-handed control.
    - **The Siege of the Fire City:** Rahu (the "Hero") advances through the Witch's EMP field to reach the **Pillar of Fire**, fulfilling the prophecy of the "First Martyr."
    - **Indigenous Resistance:** Scrappy human survivors attempting to defend their scavenged home (the ruins of the old base) with primitive weapons, only to be effortlessly brushed aside by the Metal Vessels' superior Synodic technology.
    - **The Secret War:**
        - AI Lynn's spectral interface blooming in Lem's HUD.
        - Electronic Snakes slithering through the glowing White Forest.
        - The Analog Sanctuary: Oscilloscopes pulsing in the dark, survivors in interface helmets.
    - **Year 22 AT Developments (The Great Stalemate):**
        - **The Disguise:** Lem in a parched, tan technician's uniform in the **Cradle Zero** plaza. He is surrounded by "happy" citizens in open-air cafes, a festive, slave-driven paradise built on Gorgon labor.
        - **The Warning:** **Iris Novak** grabbing Lem's arm in the crowded city center, a look of desperate urgency on her face as she warns the "King of the Gorgons" to flee.
        - **The Mirror Greeting:** Inside the **Spire City** (Pillar of Fire), Lem and a non-aggressive Gorgon mirroring each other's gestures—palms open with glowing light nodes.
        - **The Propaganda:** A massive city-wide broadcast showing **Arlo's village** on high-resolution screens, designating it as a "terrorist cell."
    - **AI Lynn Interface:** A flickering, teal-colored data-stream over **Lem's** vision as he watches the Archivists' "mercy mission" from the shadows.
- **Final Shot:** A serene view from Earth (Year 15 AT). The sky has cleared (The Archivists are "clearing the air"), revealing the Moon fragments scattered across the horizon in a galaxy-like trail.
- **Ending:** Title text "**Forgotten Future**" and project information are displayed over this final serene shot, showing the contrast between the manufactured "paradise" cities on the horizon and the tattered *New Chronology* book in the foreground.
