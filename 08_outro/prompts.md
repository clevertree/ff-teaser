# AI Prompts: 08_outro

**Style Guide:** Cinematic, dark sci-fi, realistic epic sci-fi, H.R. Giger meets H.G. Wells, grainy 70s film stock aesthetic, high detail, 8k.

## Hero Image 1: The Great Beast (Elder Monolith)
**Prompt:** A massive, stadium-sized mechanical entity—**The Great Beast**—looming in the distance through thick smog. It is a slow, lumbering **Monolith** with **two massive legs and two primary arms** that reach the ground. Its enormous head arches forward as if perpetually peering down at the ruins. Its menacing eyes glow with a dim, red light. It follows a preprogrammed industrial routine, ignored by the human populace as if it were a natural landscape feature. (Grown organic-mechanical hybrid; NOT a Wellsian tripod.)

## Hero Image 2: The Witch (Mara Manifestation)
**Prompt:** A shaggy, flickering humanoid figure—**The Witch**—appearing to be composed of disintegrating metal fragments, Aetheric blue water, and sparks of Fire. It looks highly unstable, its form constantly shedding shards like metal dust. It is a terrifying, emergent Synodic anomaly. 
Note: No generic witch attributes (hats, etc.). The "witch" look comes from the shaggy, hanging metal shrapnel and tattered Aetheric flow.

## Hero Image 3: The Witch's Pulse Shield (Surface Contact)
**Prompt:** A manifestation of **The Witch** being struck by a barrage of bullets. The surface of its body is glowing with an intense white-blue electrical charge. The moment the metal bullets touch the shaggy metal exterior of the entity, they explode into sparks of molten orange liquid and are deflected away. A high-speed, cinematic capture of kinetic energy being converted into thermal discharge upon contact. 
(Demonstrates the surface-pulse mechanic where the entity's high-voltage charge melts projectiles.)

## Hero Image 4: Metal Vessel Phalanx (Archivist Vanguard)
**Prompt:** Clinical, efficient, and faceless **Metal Vessels** in precise phalanx formations. Their armor is clean, Synodic-grown, and clinical (organic-industrial). They stand in stark contrast to the unstable chaos of the Witch. These are shared-consciousness units operating as a single, silent machine.

## Hero Image 5: Final Serene Sky
**Prompt:** A serene view from the ground looking at the horizon and Earth's sky during the dawn. 
The sky has cleared enough to reveal the Moon fragments scattered across the horizon and sky. Peaceful but scarred.

## Additional/Alternate Shots (Story Context: The After Time, Year 15 AT)

### Shot: Lem in the Shadows
**Prompt:** The Wood Vessel (Lem) standing alone in a mechanical forest of white trees, observing the slow evolution of Mechanical Cells. His silhouette is contemplative, surrounded by the living machines he was blamed for creating. (Visualizes Lem's isolation and witness to the unfolding tragedy.)

### Shot: Lynn's Isolation
**Prompt:** Lynn (the Water Vessel) in a vast, glass-like desert of Glazed Ocean, her figure small against the shimmering, vitrified landscape. She is distant from the Fire Cities, seeking isolation from those who worship her. (Captures her role as the scapegoated "Witch of the Glass Oceans.")

### Shot: General Tor's Awakening
**Prompt:** General Tor, massive and imposing, standing at the edge of a Fire City, looking up at the pillars of fire with a new expression—confusion and pain. For the first time, he questions the routines he followed. (Shows his moment of awakening from internal slumber.)

### Shot: AI Lynn interface
**Prompt:** Inside Lem's visual field (HUD), a spectral, low-resolution projection of Lynn's face (the Water Vessel). She is monochromatic blue and glitchy, providing mission markers and warnings. (The software legacy guiding Lem.)

### Shot: Electronic Snakes
**Prompt:** Massive, metallic serpents with segmented backbones and glowing data-veins, slithering through the "White Forest" of mechanical trees. They are designed to hunt and "consume" digital signals. 10 meters long, menacing.

### Shot: Analog Sanctuary 
**Prompt:** Human survivors in a high-tech but "analog" sanctuary. They are surrounded by bulky monitors, wave-forms on oscilloscopes, and hand-drawn maps. A survivor is wearing an "Analog Interface Helmet" with copper wires and lenses. No digital screens visible.

### Shot: The Forgotten Prophecy
**Prompt:** A close-up of the "Prophecy of the King of Terror" quatrain, written on an old, faded document. It sits in dust, no longer believed to be relevant—the prophecy was fulfilled, and now it's just history. (Circles back to the opening, showing how the prophecy has become forgotten mythology.)

### Copilot Note for All Prompts Files
> **Synchronization Protocol:** Whenever ff-story world-building is updated (characters, timeline, mechanical ecology, faction details), review all ff-teaser prompts.md files and update them to maintain narrative alignment. Add new alternate/additional shots that reflect story developments, particularly:
> - Major character revelations and conflicts (Vessel rebellions, Tor's awakening, etc.)
> - Wuxing elemental interactions (Fire vs. Water, Earth holding back Metal, etc.)
> - Public perception shifts (Decade of Revelation, Media Flood, Thousand-Year Fallacy realization)
> - Mechanical evolution (Fire Cities, Gorgons, Metal Vessels, Mechanical Cells)
> - Environmental consequences (Smog accumulation, Glazing, seismic instability)
> This ensures the visual teaser remains consistent with and supports the narrative depth of the story.
