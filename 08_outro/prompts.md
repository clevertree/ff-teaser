## Hero Image 1: The Great Beast
**Prompt:** Massive slow tripod figures - mechanical creature the size of a stadium looming in the distance through thick smog. Its menacing eyes glow with a dim, red light.
These are the same figures that were used in the first scene, slightly evolved. They have become useless in the future and roam around in the darkness following preprogrammed paths.

## Hero Image 2: Witch Humanoids
**Prompt:** Faceless, witch-like humanoids in shaggy, disintegrating tiny metal fragments. They appear unstable, as if just formed from dust. Eerie, supernatural, mechanical. 
Note: No witch hats or brooms or anything associated with witch lore. 
The witches are made of technology - tiny balls, hooks, and fragments that come together to form big machines

## Hero Image 3: Electromagnetic Vortex
**Prompt:** A witch-like figure posing on the ground, generating a shimmering electromagnetic vortex that deflects incoming projectiles and energy beams. Shadowy figures in the background are being pushed back by the force.

## Hero Image 4: Final Serene Sky
**Prompt:** A serene view from the ground looking at the horizon and Earth's sky during the dawn. 
The sky has cleared enough to reveal the Moon fragments scattered across the horizon and sky. Peaceful but scarred.
