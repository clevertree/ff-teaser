# AI Prompts: 08_outro

**Style Guide:** Cinematic, dark sci-fi, realistic epic sci-fi, H.R. Giger meets H.G. Wells, grainy 70s film stock aesthetic, high detail, 8k.

## Hero Image 1: The Great Beast (Elder Monolith)
**Prompt:** A massive, stadium-sized mechanical entity—**The Great Beast**—looming in the distance through thick smog. It is a slow, lumbering **Monolith** with **two massive legs and two primary arms** that reach the ground. Its enormous head arches forward as if perpetually peering down at the ruins. Its menacing eyes glow with a dim, red light. It follows a preprogrammed industrial routine, ignored by the human populace as if it were a natural landscape feature. (Grown organic-mechanical hybrid; NOT a Wellsian tripod.)

## Hero Image 2: The Witch (Maya Manifestation)
**Prompt:** A shaggy, flickering humanoid figure—**The Witch**—appearing to be composed of disintegrating metal fragments, Aetheric blue water, and sparks of Fire. It looks highly unstable, its form constantly shedding shards like metal dust. It is a terrifying, emergent Synodic anomaly. 
Note: No generic witch attributes (hats, etc.). The "witch" look comes from the shaggy, hanging metal shrapnel and tattered Aetheric flow.

## Hero Image 3: The Witch's Pulse Shield (Surface Contact)
**Prompt:** A manifestation of **The Witch** being struck by a barrage of bullets. The surface of its body is glowing with an intense white-blue electrical charge. The moment the metal bullets touch the shaggy metal exterior of the entity, they explode into sparks of molten orange liquid and are deflected away. A high-speed, cinematic capture of kinetic energy being converted into thermal discharge upon contact. 
(Demonstrates the surface-pulse mechanic where the entity's high-voltage charge melts projectiles.)

## Hero Image 4: Metal Vessel Phalanx (Archivist Vanguard)
**Prompt:** Clinical, efficient, and faceless **Metal Vessels** in precise phalanx formations. Their armor is clean, Synodic-grown, and clinical (organic-industrial). They stand in stark contrast to the unstable chaos of the Witch. These are shared-consciousness units operating as a single, silent machine.

## Hero Image 5: Final Serene Sky
**Prompt:** A serene view from the ground looking at the horizon and Earth's sky during the dawn. 
The sky has cleared enough to reveal the Moon fragments scattered across the horizon and sky. Peaceful but scarred.

## Hero Image 6: Lem's Technician Disguise (Cradle Zero)
**Prompt:** Lem (the Wood Vessel) in a parched, tan technician's uniform, standing in a crowded, festive city plaza at **Cradle Zero**. The city is built with **Synodic mounds** of matte substrate integrated into white stone high-rises. Citizens are laughing in open-air cafes, unaware of the **Striders** (Wellsian tripods) cleaning windows above them. Lem's eyes look slightly out of focus—he looks like a ghost in a costume of static. (Visualizes the Core's festive, slave-driven paradise.)

## Hero Image 7: Iris Novak's Warning
**Prompt:** A tense, close-up encounter between **Iris Novak** and **Lem** in the middle of a crowded Hive City plaza. Iris, in her severe Chief Science Officer uniform, has a firm grip on Lem's arm, her face tight with urgency. Scanning drones hover overhead, their red lights blinking. She is warning the "King of the Gorgons" that his time has run out. (Captures the fragmentation within the Core leadership.)

## Hero Image 8: The Mirror Greeting (Inside the Spire)
**Prompt:** Inside a vast, silent **Spire City** (Fire City). Lem stands before a non-aggressive **Gorgon** in a low-slung, six-legged mechanical crawler. Both have their right arms raised, palms open toward each other, revealing a small **glowing white node** in the center of their palms. A column of intense fire roars in the distance, but the foreground is stone-cold and perfectly still. (Gorgon is metallic, fluid, and non-threatening.)

## Hero Image 9: The Mirror Greeting (Dream State)
**Prompt:** Aetheric dream-state projection of a **Gorgon's true humanoid self-image**. A small, translucent humanoid entity with massive, unblinking eyes and delicate, hairless limbs. It floats in a nutrient-rich bath within a glowing, aetheric bubble. It communicates through sharp, rhythmic ripples of red and blue light. (Visualizes the creature inside the machine.)

## Hero Image 10: The Propaganda Strike (Arlo's Village)
**Prompt:** A massive city-wide broadcast on multiple monolithic screens at **Cradle Zero**. The screen shows a high-resolution surveillance photo of **Arlo's village** (wood-core huts, northern wilderness). A headline in bold, clinical Archivist font reads: "TERRORIST CELL IDENTIFIED: NORTHERN VILLAGE SECURITY THREAT." Festive city lights and laughing citizens are reflected in the glass of the screens.

## Additional/Alternate Shots (Story Context: The After Time, Year 15 AT)

### Shot: Lem in the Shadows
**Prompt:** A close-up of the "Prophecy of the King of Terror" quatrain, written on an old, faded document. It sits in dust, no longer believed to be relevant—the prophecy was fulfilled, and now it's just history. (Circles back to the opening, showing how the prophecy has become forgotten mythology.)

### Copilot Note for All Prompts Files
> **Synchronization Protocol:** Whenever ff-story world-building is updated (characters, timeline, mechanical ecology, faction details), review all ff-teaser prompts.md files and update them to maintain narrative alignment. Add new alternate/additional shots that reflect story developments, particularly:
> - Major character revelations and conflicts (Vessel rebellions, Tor's awakening, etc.)
> - Wuxing elemental interactions (Fire vs. Water, Earth holding back Metal, etc.)
> - Public perception shifts (Decade of Revelation, Media Flood, Thousand-Year Fallacy realization)
> - Mechanical evolution (Fire Cities, Gorgons, Metal Vessels, Mechanical Cells)
> - Environmental consequences (Smog accumulation, Glazing, seismic instability)
> This ensures the visual teaser remains consistent with and supports the narrative depth of the story.
