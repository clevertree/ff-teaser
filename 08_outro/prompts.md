# AI Prompts: 08_outro

**Style Guide:** Cinematic, dark sci-fi, realistic epic sci-fi, H.R. Giger meets H.G. Wells, grainy 70s film stock aesthetic, high detail, 8k.

## Hero Image 1: The Great Beast
**Prompt:** Massive slow tripod figures - mechanical creature the size of a stadium looming in the distance through thick smog. Its menacing eyes glow with a dim, red light.
These are the same figures that were used in the first scene, slightly evolved. They have become useless in the future and roam around in the darkness following preprogrammed paths.

## Hero Image 2: Witch Humanoids
**Prompt:** Faceless, witch-like humanoids in shaggy, disintegrating tiny metal fragments. They appear unstable, as if just formed from dust. Eerie, supernatural, mechanical. 
Note: No witch hats or brooms or anything associated with witch lore. 
The witches are made of technology - tiny balls, hooks, and fragments that come together to form big machines

## Hero Image 3: Electromagnetic Vortex
**Prompt:** A witch-like figure posing on the ground, generating a shimmering electromagnetic vortex that deflects incoming projectiles and energy beams. Shadowy figures in the background are being pushed back by the force.

## Hero Image 4: Final Serene Sky
**Prompt:** A serene view from the ground looking at the horizon and Earth's sky during the dawn. 
The sky has cleared enough to reveal the Moon fragments scattered across the horizon and sky. Peaceful but scarred.

## Additional/Alternate Shots (Story Context: The After Time, Year 15 AT)

### Shot: Lem in the Shadows
**Prompt:** The Wood Vessel (Lem) standing alone in a mechanical forest of white trees, observing the slow evolution of Mechanical Cells. His silhouette is contemplative, surrounded by the living machines he was blamed for creating. (Visualizes Lem's isolation and witness to the unfolding tragedy.)

### Shot: Lynn's Isolation
**Prompt:** Lynn (the Water Vessel) in a vast, glass-like desert of Glazed Ocean, her figure small against the shimmering, vitrified landscape. She is distant from the Fire Cities, seeking isolation from those who worship her. (Captures her role as the scapegoated "Witch of the Glass Oceans.")

### Shot: General Tor's Awakening
**Prompt:** General Tor, massive and imposing, standing at the edge of a Fire City, looking up at the pillars of fire with a new expression—confusion and pain. For the first time, he questions the routines he followed. (Shows his moment of awakening from internal slumber.)

### Shot: The Archivists
**Prompt:** A small group of survivors in a hidden archive, surrounded by Pre-Fry books and digital storage devices they've managed to preserve. They study yellowed documents, trying to prove the world is only 15 years old, not 1,000. (References the Archivists' struggle against the Thousand-Year Fallacy.)

### Shot: The Forgotten Prophecy
**Prompt:** A close-up of the "Prophecy of the King of Terror" quatrain, written on an old, faded document. It sits in dust, no longer believed to be relevant—the prophecy was fulfilled, and now it's just history. (Circles back to the opening, showing how the prophecy has become forgotten mythology.)

### Copilot Note for All Prompts Files
> **Synchronization Protocol:** Whenever ff-story world-building is updated (characters, timeline, mechanical ecology, faction details), review all ff-teaser prompts.md files and update them to maintain narrative alignment. Add new alternate/additional shots that reflect story developments, particularly:
> - Major character revelations and conflicts (Vessel rebellions, Tor's awakening, etc.)
> - Wuxing elemental interactions (Fire vs. Water, Earth holding back Metal, etc.)
> - Public perception shifts (Decade of Revelation, Media Flood, Thousand-Year Fallacy realization)
> - Mechanical evolution (Fire Cities, Gorgons, Metal Vessels, Mechanical Cells)
> - Environmental consequences (Smog accumulation, Glazing, seismic instability)
> This ensures the visual teaser remains consistent with and supports the narrative depth of the story.
