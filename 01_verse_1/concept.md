**Timing:** 0:33 - 1:05

## Lyrics Context
- The moon shook
- And curled up like gentle fire
- The ocean glazed
- And melted wire
- Voices buzzed in spiral eyes
- Stars dived in blinding skies

## Visual Ideas
- **00:33 - The Moon Shook:** Starts with the serene daytime shot from the intro. Immediately, the camera shakes violently as the ground reverberates. The **Lunar Capacitor** within the moon activates; the moon slowly becomes more luminous; plasma erupts from its poles and flows out into the sky like "gentle fire."
- **00:42 - The Ocean Glazed:** Cut to a shot of the ocean. The **Lunar Capacitor's** high-energy discharge vitrifies the water surface, spreading a glass-like glaze toward the horizon.
- **00:46 - Melted Wire:** Cut to a city setting. A tight closeup of a power line as it begins to sag and melt from the rapidly increasing atmospheric heat and electromagnetic surge.
- **00:56 - Voices Buzzed:** Cut to a city street full of people. They haven't felt the heat yet, but they are looking up in terror at the moon erupting above the horizon.
- **01:00 - Stars Dived:** The moon reaches a blinding white luminosity. The resulting **Great Fry** (EMP) causes orbiting debris and moon fragments to fall from the sky, appearing as blinding flames ("stars diving").
