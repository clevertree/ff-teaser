# Video Generation Prompt: Verse 1 (30 Seconds)

**Overall Style:** Cinematic photorealistic sci-fi. 35mm grain, 1970s "Apollo-era" film stock aesthetic. High-contrast, dark atmospheric lighting with bursts of intense cyan and golden energy.

**The Sequence (Timing Guide):**
1. **00:00-00:08 (The Moon Shook):** A macro close-up of the Moon’s surface. Suddenly, the cratered ground shudders, and ancient, buried mechanical structures—looking like a cross between a clockwork engine and a ribcage—partially emerge. Cyan-blue "Aether" plasma leaks from the fissures like liquid fire, defying gravity and curling upward into the blackness of space.
2. **00:08-00:15 (The Ocean Glazed):** Transition to a wide shot of a terrestrial coastline. A massive monolithic shadow (a stadium-sized industrial frame) stands in the shallow water. Where its spindly, metallic legs touch the ocean, the water instantly freezes into a crystalline, steaming glaze of molten glass. The air ripples with intense heat distortion.
3. **00:15-00:22 (Voices Buzzed):** A suburban neighborhood at dusk. TV screens in dark windows flicker with distorted "Alien" signal leaks. In the street, children stand perfectly still, staring at the sky. Their eyes reflect a faint, spiraling green pattern—the "Wood" element infection (Lem’s signature). Faint mechanical vines begin to grow over the power lines, causing them to sag and glow with heat.
4. **00:22-00:30 (Stars Dived):** Looking up from the street. The sky begins to fracture. Massive silent pulses of white-hot plasma drop from the Moon like falling stars, trailing long streaks of fire. They aren't shooting stars—they are targeting pulses. The scene ends as the entire sky flashes a blinding, "grid-collapsing" white.

## HailuoAI Agent Optimized Command:
**Prompt:** Create a 30s cinematic video in 4K. **Scene 1:** Macro moon surface shifting to reveal hidden mechanical ribs as cyan fire curls upward. **Scene 2:** A stadium-sized spindly monolith standing in the sea, turning water into steaming crystalline glass. **Scene 3:** A suburban street where children watch the sky, green spiral patterns glowing in their pupils as power lines melt into liquid metal above them. **Scene 4:** Thousands of white plasma bolts diving from the moon toward Earth, trailing smoke, ending in a blinding atmospheric flash. **Style:** Realistic 1970s film aesthetic, high-contrast, Giger-esque industrial design, catastrophic scale. **No text or lyrics.**
