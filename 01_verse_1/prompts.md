# AI Prompts: 01_verse_1

**Style Guide:** Cinematic, dark sci-fi, realistic epic sci-fi, H.R. Giger meets H.G. Wells, grainy 70s film stock aesthetic, high detail, 8k.

## Hero Image 1: Moon Eruption
**Prompt:** A serene daytime moon suddenly erupting with luminous plasma from its poles. The plasma flows out into the sky like gentle fire. The ground below is shaking, dust rising. Cinematic, high energy, realistic.

## Hero Image 2: Glazing Ocean
**Prompt:** A hyper-realistic, high-resolution photograph of a vast ocean under a massive, glowing moon. 
The water surface is steaming and shimmering crystalline glaze like molten glass. The atmosphere is heavy with a warm, golden heat haze. The moon's reflection is distorted by the changing texture of the water. Cinematic, photorealistic, 8k.

## Hero Image 3: Melting Power Lines
**Prompt:** A high-resolution, cinematic of high tension power overhead electrical cables against an expansive horizon. 
The metal is glowing and warping, sagging into fluid, molten shapes. Intense heat distortion in the air, shimmering atmosphere, industrial aesthetic, photorealistic, 8k.

## Hero Image 4: Blinding Heat Blast
**Prompt:** The moon glowing blinding white, firing a devastating beam of heat and energy down toward Earth. Space debris and moon fragments falling in flames like diving stars. Apocalyptic, intense light.

## Hero Image 5: Moon Detail Variation
**Reference:** 00_intro/01_the_moon/hero_1_the_moon.jpg
**Prompt:** A high-detail variation of the moon from the intro, showing more craters and surface texture.

## Additional/Alternate Shots (Story Context: Lem's Uncontrollable Nature)

### Shot: Wood Element Eruption
**Prompt:** Green, organic-looking Aether energy swirling around the moon's eruption—a burst of biomimetic growth escaping the lunar surface. Vines of luminous technology reaching into space. (Reflects Lem's uncontrolled Wood element nature and the mechanical infection spreading.)

### Shot: The Caucasian Eagle Descent
**Prompt:** A colossal capital spaceship, *The Caucasian Eagle*, its hull scorched and venting gas, plummeting toward the cratered lunar surface. Massive debris rings of lunar rock spiral around it. The scale is monumental. (Matches Ch. 8 of the manuscript.)

### Shot: Floating Debris Rings
**Prompt:** Rings of lunar rock and mechanical debris spiraling upward from the Moon's surface, caught in an impossible gravitational or aetheric pull. The Moon glows with inner heat behind the fragments. (Reflects the physics of the Cataclysm.)

### Shot: Lem's Activation
**Prompt:** An adolescent boy (Lem) on Earth, his eyes glowing with a faint green light as a remote compulsion link is established. Patterns of mechanical Wood-technology spread across his skin like bark. (Lynn forcing his activation.)

### Copilot Note
> Repeat this process over time: Whenever ff-story is updated, review and update ff-teaser prompts to ensure visual and conceptual alignment. Add new alternate shots as the narrative evolves.
