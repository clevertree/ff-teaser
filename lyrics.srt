1
00:00:33,659 --> 00:00:35,000
The moon shook

2
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:42,659
And curled up like gentle fire

3
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:46,820
The ocean glazed

4
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:56,219
And melted wire

5
00:00:56,219 --> 00:01:00,539
Voices buzzed in spiral eyes

6
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:05,920
Stars dived in blinding skies

7
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:20,120
Stars die

8
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:40,219
Blinding skies

9
00:01:40,219 --> 00:01:44,870
Tree cracked

10
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:51,140
And mountain cried

11
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:57,540
Bridges broke

12
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,099
And window sighed

13
00:02:02,099 --> 00:02:07,599
Cells grew up and rivers burst

14
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:12,080
Sound obscured and sense reversed

15
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:26,360
Stars die

16
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:40,000
Blinding skies

17
00:02:40,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:35,270
And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth

19
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:42,639
Idle mind

20
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:47,979
And severed soul

21
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:52,000
Silent nerves

22
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,939
And begging bowl

23
00:03:57,939 --> 00:04:03,840
Shallow haze to blast a way

24
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:10,439
Hyper sleep to end the day

25
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:20,970
Stars die

26
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,970
Blinding skies
