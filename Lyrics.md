[Intro]
[00:00.00] (Instrumental Buildup)

[Verse 1: Steven Wilson]
[00:33.66] The moon shook
[00:35.00] And curled up like gentle fire
[00:42.66] The ocean glazed
[00:46.82] And melted wire
[00:56.22] Voices buzzed in spiral eyes
[01:00.54] Stars dived in blinding skies

[Chorus: Steven Wilson]
[01:05.92] Stars die
[01:20.12] Blinding skies

[Verse 2: Steven Wilson]
[01:40.22] Tree cracked
[01:44.87] And mountain cried
[01:51.14] Bridges broke
[01:57.54] And window sighed
[02:02.10] Cells grew up and rivers burst
[02:07.60] Sound obscured and sense reversed

[Chorus: Steven Wilson]
[02:12.08] Stars die
[02:26.36] Blinding skies

[Interlude: Richard Nixon]
[CUT] Hello, Neil and Buzz
[CUT] I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made from the White House
[CUT] I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you have done
[CUT] For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives
[02:40.00] Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world
[03:00.00] And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth

[Verse 3: Steven Wilson]
[03:35.27] Idle mind
[03:42.64] And severed soul
[03:47.98] Silent nerves
[03:52.00] And begging bowl
[03:57.94] Shallow haze to blast a way
[04:03.84] Hyper sleep to end the day

[Chorus: Steven Wilson]
[04:10.44] Stars die
[04:20.97] Blinding skies

[Outro]
[04:41.00] (Final Fade Out)
