# AI Prompts: 06_verse_3

**Style Guide:** Cinematic, dark sci-fi, realistic epic sci-fi, H.R. Giger meets H.G. Wells, grainy 70s film stock aesthetic, high detail, 8k.

## Hero Image 1: Future War & Pillar of Fire
**Prompt:** A dark, smog-filled future battlefield. A tremendous, blinding pillar of fire reaches from the ground to the black sky. Tripods move in the distance.

## Hero Image 2: Mechanical White Forest 
**Prompt:** An artificial forest made of glowing white technological trees. Luminous circuits and metal branches, no organic life. Eerie, cold light.

## Hero Image 3: Desert Base
**Prompt:** A high-tech metal base built into a desolate desert with sharp cliffs and deep valleys. Desolate, industrial, futuristic.

## Hero Image 4: Person on Moon Fragment
**Prompt:** A lone, unknown person sitting on a floating fragment of the destroyed Moon in space, quietly watching the dark, smog-covered Earth below. There should only be one complete planet showing - Earth, no others aside from moon fragments

## Hero Image 5: Space Ship Launch
**Prompt:** A futuristic, space-capable ship taking off from a dark Earth, piercing through the smog layer into orbit.

## Hero Image 6: Incubating Cube
**Prompt:** A futuristic, glowing incubating cube. Inside, a humanoid lifeform is slowly growing. High-tech, biological-mechanical hybrid.

## Additional/Alternate Shots (Story Context: Dr. Aris Vane & Metal Vessels)

### Shot: The Metal Vessel Creation
**Prompt:** A gleaming, featureless humanoid figure emerging from an Aether-fueled incubation chamber. Its surface is smooth, reflective metal with glowing circuit-lines. Multiple identical units line the walls behind it. (Visualizes the creation of the perfectly obedient Metal Synanthropes.)

### Shot: Dr. Aris Vane's Dilemma
**Prompt:** A woman (Aris Vane) standing in a high-tech laboratory, looking at blueprints for the Metal Vessels with a complex expression—ambition, regret, and resignation. The lab reflects cold, clinical light. (Captures her reluctant decision to build the Metal units.)

### Shot: The Fire Cities' Expansion
**Prompt:** Multiple pillars of fire rising from different locations across a smog-covered Earth. The pillars connect in a web of energy arcs. The smog thickens. (Shows how the Fire Cities multiply and intensify the atmospheric darkness.)

### Shot: Mechanical Forest Growth
**Prompt:** A "Wood" element forest of glowing white and silver mechanical trees spreading across a desolate landscape. Their branches form intricate circuits and geometric patterns. (Visualizes the Wood element machines constructing their structures.)
