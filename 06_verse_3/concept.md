## Visual Ideas
- **03:23 - Music Kicks In:** Immediate cut to several fast shots of wars occurring in the future. Tripods are active, moving through the dark distance. The sky is choked with black smog. A tremendous, blinding pillar of fire reaches from the ground to the sky, causing the dark smog to spread across the Earth.
- **03:35.27 - Idle Mind:** A shot of an artificial "mechanical" forest with bright, luminous trees made of technology. No organic life is visible.
- **03:42.64 - And Severed Soul:** A shot of a high-tech metal base built in a desolate desert with endless valleys and random sharp cliffs.
- **03:47.98 - Silent Nerves:** A shot from space. An unknown person sits on a floating fragment of the destroyed Moon, watching the Earth quietly.
- **03:52.00 - And Begging Bowl:** A shot of rugged-looking towns devoid of technology, enduring the new dark ages in a cold wind.
- **03:57.94 - Shallow Haze to Blast a Way:** A futuristic space-capable ship takes off from Earth and enters orbit.
- **04:03.84 - Hyper Sleep to End the Day:** A shot of a futuristic incubating cube with a humanoid lifeform growing within.
