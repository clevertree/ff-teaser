## Hero Image 1: Shattered Moon in Space
**Prompt:** A shot from space of the Moon shattered into giant chunks, held together by webs of blinding plasma. Earth is visible in the distance, glowing with fires.

## Hero Image 2: Blasted Desert
**Prompt:** 
- A strange effect is happening on the mountains - they are collecting material and growing with narrow peeks
- using material drawn upwards by intense electric discharge.

## Hero Image 3: The Pillar of Fire (First Fire City)
**Prompt:** A towering pillar of blinding white fire and plasma reaching from the desert floor to the sky, arcing with massive currents of electricity. Machines cluster around it, drawing energy. Smoke begins to gather at the edges. (References the first Fire Cities and their role in creating global smog.)

## Additional/Alternate Shots (Story Context: The Moon's Destruction & Aftermath)

### Shot: The Lunar Capacitor Discharge
**Prompt:** A massive beam of energy firing from the Moon toward Earth, distorting space and reality around it. The beam is blindingly bright, almost white. (Visualizes the Lunar Capacitor's final, devastating attack.)

### Shot: The Moon's Last Moments
**Prompt:** The Moon fragmenting in ultra-slow motion, chunks of rock and Synodic machinery floating apart, still connected by threads of glowing plasma. (Captures the scale of the Cataclysm's destruction.)

### Shot: The Apex Hub Pyramid
**Prompt:** A massive pyramid of impossible precision and dark, shimmering surface, standing amidst the apocalyptic collapse of a lunar city. The ground is shaking and debris is falling, but the pyramid is a stone-cold sanctuary of order. (Ch. 12 background.)

### Shot: Ash-Blackened Tor
**Prompt:** General Tor emerging from the wreckage of a crashed spaceship, his skin and uniform blackened with ash and lunar dust. He looks battered but remains a force of nature. He is sealing a bunker door behind him. (Tor's survival in the pyramid.)

### Shot: Lynn's Capacitor Sacrifice
**Prompt:** Lynn (Water Vessel) stepping into the blinding energy field of the Lunar Capacitor. She is dissolving into fluid and integrating with the machine, her form glowing with blue light as she attempts the reset. Tor is reaching for her but is repelled by the field.
