# Section Concept: 04_chorus_2
**Timing:** 2:12 - 2:40

## Lyrics Context
- Stars die
- Blinding skies

## Visual Ideas
- **02:12 - Stars Die:** Shot from space. The Earth's Moon is shattered into pieces with giant chunks remaining. Blinding plasma flows between the fragments, holding them in a loose, chaotic formation. Show seperate chunks spreading out. 
- **02:26 - Blinding Skies:** Cut to a shot from Earth in a desert blasted from intense heat (**Cradle Zero**).
- A strange effect is happening on the mountains—they are collecting material and growing with narrow peaks using material drawn upwards by intense electric discharge. This is the first stage of **Synodic Reconstruction**.
- **The Pillar of Fire:** A towering column of plasma marks the site of the first **Fire City**.
- **Sequence: The Sanctuary:**
    - The dark, precise pyramid of the Cradle Prime.
    - Ajax, ash-blackened and scarred, sealing the sanctuary door.
    - Lynn's final sacrifice as she dissolves into the Lunar Capacitor.
- Increasing visual distortion as we approach the Nixon interlude, signifying the collapse of historical consensus.
