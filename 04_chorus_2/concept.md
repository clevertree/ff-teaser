**Timing:** 2:12 - 2:40

## Lyrics Context
- Stars die
- Blinding skies

## Visual Ideas
- **02:12 - Stars Die:** Shot from space. The Moon is shattered into pieces with giant chunks remaining. Blinding plasma flows between the fragments, holding them in a loose, chaotic formation.
- **02:26 - Blinding Skies:** Cut to a shot from Earth. Massive chunks of the Moon are seen falling through the atmosphere, striking mountains and cities with blinding explosions.
- Increasing visual distortion as we approach the Nixon interlude.
