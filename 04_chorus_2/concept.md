# Section Concept: 04_chorus_2
**Timing:** 2:12 - 2:40

## Lyrics Context
- Stars die
- Blinding skies

## Visual Ideas
- **02:12 - Stars Die:** Shot from space. The Earth's Moon is shattered into pieces with giant chunks remaining. Blinding plasma flows between the fragments, holding them in a loose, chaotic formation. Show seperate chunks spreading out. 
- **02:26 - Blinding Skies:** Cut to a shot from Earth in a desert blasted from instense heat.
- A strange effect is happening on the mountains - they are collecting material and growing with narrow peeks
- using material drawn upwards by intense electric discharge. 
- Increasing visual distortion as we approach the Nixon interlude.
