# Section Concept: 02_chorus_1
**Timing:** 1:05 - 1:40

## Lyrics Context
- Stars die
- Blinding skies

## Visual Ideas
- **01:05 - Stars Die:** Cut to a wide shot of the Moon in close proximity to the Earth. The heat blast continues to strike the planet. The Moon is now fully erupted, appearing as a disintegrating ball of rock and plasma. The scene cuts between different dramatic angles of this celestial destruction.
- **01:20 - Blinding Skies:** Cut back to a "from-Earth" perspective. The Moon has become a blinding fireball dominating the sky.
- **The Walkers:** During this 20-second sequence, we see the **Tripod Walkers** (introduced in the intro). They are now active inside the city, systematically dismantling buildings. They wield giant, invisible heat rays (consistent with H.G. Wells' *War of the Worlds* concepts). Crucially, they seem completely uninterested in the Moon's cataclysm, focused entirely on their own work agendas.
- Transitioning back to a more grounded but still surreal landscape for the next verse.
