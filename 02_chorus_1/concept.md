# Section Concept: 02_chorus_1
**Timing:** 1:05 - 1:40

## Lyrics Context
- Stars die
- Blinding skies

## Visual Ideas
- **01:05 - Stars Die:** Cut to a wide shot of the Moon in close proximity to the Earth. The heat blast continues to strike the planet. The Moon is now fully erupted, appearing as a disintegrating ball of rock and plasma. The scene cuts between different dramatic angles of this celestial destruction.
- **01:20 - Blinding Skies:** Cut back to a "from-Earth" perspective. The Moon has become a blinding fireball dominating the sky.
- **The Walkers:** During this 20-second sequence, we see the **Synodic Walkers** (introduced in the intro). They are now active inside the city, systematically "harvesting" infrastructure. They wield invisible thermal beams, dismantling or "glazing" buildings into raw materials. Crucially, they seem completely uninterested in the Moon's cataclysm, focused entirely on their own work agendas as if the destruction of the world is merely a logistical hurdle.
- Transitioning back to a more grounded but still surreal landscape for the next verse.
