## Hero Image 1: Disintegrating Moon
**Prompt:** A wide shot from space showing the Earth's Moon in close proximity to Earth. 
The Moon is a blinding white ball of rock and glowing plasma, like a second sun. 
Earth is visible in the background, partially scorched. Avoid any unnatural looking shapes or effects

## Hero Image 2: Monoliths in the City
**Prompt:** Stadium-sized organic-mechanical **Monoliths** active in a human city. They have lumbering, thick legs and massive rectangular bodies. They use mechanical arms and invisible thermal beams to systematically dismantle power grids and buildings. They are indifferent to the exploding moon in the sky above. Industrial, menacing, monumental scale. (Elder Synodics, distinct from later Wellsian Striders.)

## Additional/Alternate Shots (Story Context: The Vessels' Influence Crumbling)

### Shot: The False Saviors
**Prompt:** Inside a cathedral or place of worship, a humanoid Vessel (ambiguous, not fully human) stands before a congregation, reciting the "Prophecy of the King of Terror." The congregation looks ecstatic and terrified. Outside, through stained glass windows, the moon glows brighter. (References the Vessel Deception and the secret New Age religion.)

### Shot: The Disillusionment
**Prompt:** A close-up of a Vessel's face (could be Rahu or Lynn) showing confusion and pain as they realize the prophecy they were programmed to speak is a lie. Their eyes glow with Aether-fire. (Reflects the moment Rahu and Lynn reject their programming.)

### Shot: Fire vs. Water
**Prompt:** Rahu (Fire element) and Lynn (Water element) in a tense standoff, their Aether energies clashing—red and blue light swirling around them as they debate the truth. (Visualizes the Vessels' internal conflict and elemental opposition.)
