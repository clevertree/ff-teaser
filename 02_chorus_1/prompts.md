**Style Guide:** Cinematic, dark sci-fi, realistic epic sci-fi, H.R. Giger meets H.G. Wells, grainy 70s film stock aesthetic, high detail, 8k.

## Hero Image 1: Disintegrating Moon
**Prompt:** A wide shot from space showing the Earth's Moon in close proximity to Earth. 
The Moon is a blinding white ball of rock and glowing plasma, like a second sun. 
Earth is visible in the background, partially scorched. Avoid any unnatural looking shapes or effects

## Hero Image 2: Monoliths in the City
**Prompt:** Stadium-sized organic-mechanical **Monoliths** active in a human city. They have **two massive legs and two primary arms** that reach the ground for support and destruction. Their enormous heads arch forward, staring down at the skyscrapers. They use their mechanical arms like crane-assemblies to systematically dismantle power grids and buildings. They are indifferent to the exploding moon in the sky above. Grown industrial-biological entities, menacing, monumental scale. (Elder Synodics, distinct from later Wellsian Striders.)

## Additional/Alternate Shots (Story Context: The Vessels' Influence Crumbling)

### Shot: The False Saviors
**Prompt:** Inside a cathedral or place of worship, a humanoid Vessel (ambiguous, not fully human) stands before a congregation, reciting the "Prophecy of the King of Terror." The congregation looks ecstatic and terrified. Outside, through stained glass windows, the moon glows brighter. (References the Vessel Deception and the secret New Age religion.)

### Shot: The Disillusionment
**Prompt:** A close-up of a Vessel's face (could be Rahu or Lynn) showing confusion and pain as they realize the prophecy they were programmed to speak is a lie. Their eyes glow with Aether-fire. (Reflects the moment Rahu and Lynn reject their programming.)

### Shot: Aether-Drive Fugue
**Prompt:** A disorienting dream-state inside Lem's mind. Mission markers, tactical HUD data, and fragments of memory swirl in a dark void. Glowing green mission objectives ping and fade. (Lem's consciousness after the crash.)

### Shot: Novak's Revelation
**Prompt:** Commander Novak, a stern woman in a military officer's uniform, standing over a deactivated Lem on a cratered lunar surface. She is illuminated by the glowing moon-crust. She looks down with cold necessity as she delivers the architecture revelation.

### Shot: Rahu's Moon Threat
**Prompt:** A massive thermal signature on the lunar surface—a figure of living fire (Rahu) standing amidst jagged lunar rocks, looking up at the approaching human strike teams. The heat is so intense the air around him shimmers like a supernova.
