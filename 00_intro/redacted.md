**DATE:** [REDACTED]

## 1. Summary
This document outlines the protocols for the continued suppression of the text commonly attributed to Michel de Nostredame, hereafter referred to as the "King of Terror" prophecy. Due to its potential for mass hysteria and destabilization of established religious and political structures, all physical and digital copies are to be seized under **Executive Order 12958-X/9**.

> The end of this world will come."

## 3. Grounds for Suppression

### 3.1 Religious Sensitivities
The Vatican Liaison (Office of [REDACTED]) has expressed extreme concern regarding the "resurrection" and "beasts" descriptors. The Church has officially categorized this quatrain as a "malignant heresy" likely to incite apocalyptic cult activity. Exposure to the public would jeopardize the stability of the [REDACTED] Protocol.

### 3.2 Counter-Intelligence Operations (Fraud/Scaremongering)
To mitigate the spread, the Agency has successfully seeded disinformation campaigns across academic circles. The consensus is to be maintained that the text is a 20th-century forgery, categorized as "fear-index weaponry" and "unsubstantiated scaremongering." Any scholar attempting to verify the ink-chemistry or paper-stock of the original parchment is to be [REDACTED].

### 3.3 Executive Order 99-B (The "Silent Horizon" Mandate)
Per the mysterious directives of **Executive Order 99-B**, signed by [REDACTED] during the final hours of the [REDACTED] administration.
The order mandates "absolute cultural erasure" regarding the specific line: *"those who lead the armies of men will disappear."* 

## 4. Current Status
The original parchment is currently held in Sub-Level 4, Vault 12. Monitoring of global communications suggests that 0.004% of the population remains aware of the full text.
