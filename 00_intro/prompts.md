# AI Prompts: 00_intro

**Style Guide:** Cinematic, dark sci-fi, realistic epic sci-fi, H.R. Giger meets H.G. Wells, grainy 70s film stock aesthetic, high detail, 8k, anamorphic lens flare.

## Hero Image 1: The Moon
**Prompt:** Earth's moon hanging in a dark, star-filled night sky. Ominous serene atmosphere.

## Hero Image 2: Moon over Water
**Prompt:** Earth's moon reflecting in a calm, dark ocean at night. Eerie silence, dark blue and silver color palette. Cinematic, grainy film stock.

## Hero Image 3: Moon over Desert
**Prompt:** The moon hanging over a vast, silent desert with sharp rock formations. Long shadows, desolate atmosphere. 70s sci-fi aesthetic.

## Hero Image 4: City with Monoliths
**Prompt:** A city at night, silhouettes of buildings against a dark sky. 
Vague, towering silhouettes of stadium-sized **Monoliths** standing motionless in the distance staring down at the city. They feature **two massive legs and two primary arms** stretched to the ground, and enormous heads that arch forward over the buildings. They appear "grown" (biomimetic organic-mechanical) rather than industrially built.
The Earth's moon is visible behind them. Dark, atmospheric, monumental scale. (These are the Elder Synodics, often mistakenly called "Tripods" by the public.)

## Redacted Quote
**Prompt:** Pretend there was a redacted quote from Nostradamus.
```
In the year 202X from heaven will come a Great King of Terror.
The dead will rise from their graves. Beasts shall wear the masks of humanity.
After wars are fought and the sea's blessings vanish, those who lead the armies of men will disappear.
Nobles will seek sacrifices for their strange works.
Mankind will be filled with mistrust, and pestilence shall reign.
The end of this world will come.
-- Nostradamus (Source [REDACTED RE:ARCHIVIST-FILE-C0])
```
Briefly displayed behind/outside the quote is a case file with the words
SUBJECT: INTERCEPTION AND SUPPRESSION OF QUATRAIN X-72 (NON-CANONICAL) CLEARANCE: TOP SECRET // ARCHIVIST VETTING DATE: [REDACTED]
- This references the seed of the **Thousand-Year Fallacy**.

SUBJECT: INTERCEPTION AND SUPPRESSION OF QUATRAIN X-72 (NON-CANONICAL) CLEARANCE: TOP SECRET // EYES ONLY DATE: [REDACTED]


## Additional/Alternate Shots (Story Accurate)

### Shot: The Decade of Revelation
**Prompt:** A collage of flickering TV screens, news clippings, and digital feeds. Headlines about alien leaks, prophecies, and government conspiracies overlap and blur together. The public is distracted, faces illuminated by screens, oblivious to the real threat. (Reflects the media flood and public ignorance from ff-story.)

### Shot: Hidden Cult Ritual
**Prompt:** A shadowy, candle-lit gathering of elite figures in a modern boardroom, performing a ritual with a Vessel (humanoid, ambiguous gender, not fully human). The Vessel recites the "Prophecy of the King of Terror" as the group watches in awe and fear. (Directly references the Vessel Deception and secret religion.)

### Shot: The Arrival Overlooked
**Prompt:** A busy city street in daylight. In the background, a Tripod silhouette is visible, but the crowd is distracted by their phones and screens, ignoring the looming threat. (Visual metaphor for the public missing the signs until too late.)

### Shot: Selenite Memory
**Prompt:** A fleeting, dreamlike image of the indigenous Selenites—gentle, bioluminescent lunar beings—retreating into shadowy lunar caves as the first Synodic machines begin to grow on the Moon's surface. (References the original lunar inhabitants from ff-story.)

### Copilot Note
> Repeat this process over time: Whenever the story in ff-story is updated, review and update the prompts in ff-teaser to ensure visual and conceptual alignment. Add new alternate/extra shots as the narrative evolves.
