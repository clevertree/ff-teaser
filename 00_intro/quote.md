In the year 1999 from heaven will come a Great King of Terror.

The dead will rise from their graves. Beasts shall wear the masks of humanity.

After wars are fought and the sea's blessings vanish, those who lead the armies of men will disappear.

Nobles will seek sacrifices for their strange works.

Mankind will be filled with mistrust, and pestilence shall reign.

The end of this world will come.
