```
In the year 1999 from heaven will come a Great King of Terror.
The dead will rise from their graves. Beasts shall wear the masks of humanity.
After wars are fought and the sea's blessings vanish, those who lead the armies of men will disappear.
Nobles will seek sacrifices for their strange works.
Mankind will be filled with mistrust, and pestilence shall reign.
The end of this world will come.
-- From "Splatterworld" an unreleased NES Game

but possibly a more accurate translation from a more original source than what is accepted today. Otherwise, I have no idea where it came from.


The 72nd stanza of the tenth book of his prophecies reads:

In the year 1999 and
seven months,
from the sky will come a
great King of Terror,
He will resurrect the
King of Angelmois,
Before and afterwards Mars
rules happily.

but doesn't mention the rest of the lines.
