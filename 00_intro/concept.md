**Timing:** 0:00 - 0:33

## Lyrics Context
(Instrumental Buildup)

## Visual Ideas
- **Text Overlay:** "A conceptual teaser for Forgotten Future" (an unstarted game project).
- **Opening Shot:** The moon, large and detailed in the night sky.
- **Sequence:** Slow fades between shots of the moon from Earth in various settings:
    - Reflecting in calm water.
    - Hanging over a vast, silent desert.
    - Peeking through the canopy of a dense forest.
    - Framed by the silhouettes of a sleeping city, where the vague silhouettes of **Monoliths** can be seen standing motionless in the distance, hidden in plain sight.
- **Sequence: The Deception of Order:**
    - Mature Lynn (Maya) as a public goddess.
    - General Ajax as a symbol of military discipline.
    - Adolescent Lem living a "normal" suburban life.
- **Closing Shot:** A serene view of the moon visible during the daytime, transitioning into the first verse.
- Atmospheric buildup matching the instrumental.

## Quote
Within the first 30 seconds of the opening shot, the quote is displayed:

```
In the year 202X from heaven will come a Great King of Terror.
The dead will rise from their graves. Beasts shall wear the masks of humanity.
After wars are fought and the sea's blessings vanish, those who lead the armies of men will disappear.
Nobles will seek sacrifices for their strange works.
Mankind will be filled with mistrust, and pestilence shall reign.
The end of this world will come.
-- Nostradamus (Source [REDACTED RE:ARCHIVIST-FILE-C0])
```

Briefly displayed behind/outside the quote is a case file with the words
SUBJECT: INTERCEPTION AND SUPPRESSION OF QUATRAIN X-72 (NON-CANONICAL) CLEARANCE: TOP SECRET // ARCHIVIST VETTING DATE: [REDACTED]
- This references the seed of the **Thousand-Year Fallacy**.
