## Visual Ideas
- **Text Overlay:** "A conceptual teaser for Forgotten Future" (an unstarted game project).
- **Opening Shot:** The moon, large and detailed in the night sky.
- **Sequence:** Slow fades between shots of the moon from Earth in various settings:
    - Reflecting in calm water.
    - Hanging over a vast, silent desert.
    - Peeking through the canopy of a dense forest.
    - Framed by the silhouettes of a sleeping city, where the vague silhouettes of **Tripod Walkers** can be seen standing motionless in the distance.
- **Closing Shot:** A serene view of the moon visible during the daytime, transitioning into the first verse.
- Atmospheric buildup matching the instrumental.
