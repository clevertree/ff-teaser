**Timing:** 1:40 - 2:12

## Lyrics Context

- And mountain cried
- Bridges broke
- And window sighed
- Cells grew up and rivers burst
- Sound obscured and sense reversed

## Visual Ideas
- **01:40 - Tree Cracked:** A shot without the moon (implied above). A large tree cracks and splinters from intense heat and force, with a forest burning fiercely in the background.
- **01:44 - Mountain Cried:** Mountains are struck by massive, intense electric discharges from the sky, illuminating the peaks in jagged white light.
- **01:51 - Bridges Broke:** A shot of an old city bridge disintegrating and collapsing from the combined effects of force and heat.
- **01:57 - Window Sighed:** A shot of an old building; the entire structure, including a prominent window, is visibly melting and warping.
- **02:02 - Cells Grew Up:** Switch to a shot of a robotic, mechanical substance. Tiny globular components rapidly gather and assemble into larger blocks without much defined shape or purpose.
- **02:07 - Sound Obscured:** The energy stored within the moon finally bursts out. The moon shatters across the sky in another blinding explosion, filling the frame with light and debris.
