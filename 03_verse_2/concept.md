# Section Concept: 03_verse_2
**Timing:** 1:40 - 2:12

## Lyrics Context
- Tree cracked
- And mountain cried
- Bridges broke
- And window sighed
- Cells grew up and rivers burst
- Sound obscured and sense reversed

## Visual Ideas
- **01:40 - Tree Cracked:** A shot without the moon (implied above). A large tree cracks and splinters from intense heat and force, with a forest burning fiercely in the background.
- **01:44 - Mountain Cried:** Mountains are struck by massive, intense electric discharges from the sky, illuminating the peaks in jagged white light.
- **01:51 - Bridges Broke:** A shot of an old city bridge disintegrating and collapsing from the combined effects of force and heat.
- **01:57 - Window Sighed:** A shot of an old building; the entire structure, including a prominent window, is visibly melting and warping.
- **02:02 - Cells Grew Up:** Switch to a shot of **Synodic Shards** (Mechanical Cells). Tiny fragments rapidly replicate and assemble following **Wuxing Causality**, growing into the foundations of a **Synodic Walker** or a massive **Aether-Cradle**—an organic-mechanical hybrid that lacks any human engineering logic.
- **02:07 - Sound Obscured:** The **Lunar Capacitor** reaches peak discharge. The Moon shatters in another blinding explosion, filling the orbit with debris and marking the start of the **Great Fry**. This shot captures the "sense reversed" aspect as gravity and light warp around the discharge.
- **Sequence: The Resistance:**
    - The *Hermes* engaging Rahu on the lunar surface.
    - Ajax's stoic sacrifice on the bridge of his ship.
