# AI Prompts: 03_verse_2

**Style Guide:** Cinematic, dark sci-fi, realistic epic sci-fi, H.R. Giger meets H.G. Wells, grainy 70s film stock aesthetic, high detail, 8k.

## Hero Image 1: Burning Forest
**Prompt:** Many large trees cracking and splintering from intense heat, a forest fire raging in the background. 
The sky is orange and thick with smoke. It's day time, but the sun is obscured by heavy smoke

## Hero Image 2: Electric Mountains
**Prompt:** Jagged mountain peaks being struck by massive, intense electric discharges from a dark, turbulent sky. High contrast, dramatic lighting.

## Hero Image 3: Melting Building
**Prompt:** A realistic, high-resolution photograph of an old worn brick building. The structure is succumbing to extreme atmospheric heat, with the brickwork and ornate stone details visibly softening and sagging. Intense heat haze and shimmering air distortion. Grounded and epic aesthetic, 8k. Avoid any unnatural looking shapes or effects

## Hero Image 4: Mechanical Cells
**Prompt:** A swarm of small, metallic, globular mechanical cells gathering and self-assembling on the shore of a dark, still lake. 
The cells are forming complex, geometric structures that contrast with the organic reeds and dark water. 
The bright firey Moon glows like a 2nd sun in the sky
Eerie, technological growth in a natural setting, cinematic lighting, 8k.

## Additional/Alternate Shots (Story Context: Fire Cities Being Formed)

### Shot: The Consolidation
**Prompt:** Dozens of Fire machines dragging massive power cables, transformers, and fuel tanks into a central location. The structures pile up into a towering nest of stolen energy, crackling with arcs of electricity. The beginning of a Fire City. (Visualizes the machines' relentless consolidation of Earth's energy resources.)

### Shot: Wuxing Warfare
**Prompt:** Earth and Metal Vessels (if visible) standing against Fire machines, their elemental energies clashing. Earth element creates barriers, Metal element refracts heat, but they are slowly overwhelmed. (Reflects the Wuxing causality: Fire defeats Metal, Metal defeats Wood, Earth restrains Fire.)

### Shot: The Last Survivors
**Prompt:** A small group of humans fleeing a burning city, silhouetted against the glow of advancing Fire. The mechanical cells spread like a plague across the ground. (Captures humanity's helplessness against the Synodic invasion.)
