# AI Prompts: 03_verse_2

**Style Guide:** Cinematic, dark sci-fi, realistic epic sci-fi, H.R. Giger meets H.G. Wells, grainy 70s film stock aesthetic, high detail, 8k.

## Hero Image 1: Burning Forest
**Prompt:** Many large trees cracking and splintering from intense heat, a forest fire raging in the background. 
The sky is orange and thick with smoke. It's day time, but the sun is obscured by heavy smoke

## Hero Image 2: Electric Mountains
**Prompt:** Jagged mountain peaks being struck by massive, intense electric discharges from a dark, turbulent sky. High contrast, dramatic lighting.

## Hero Image 3: Melting Building
**Prompt:** A realistic, high-resolution photograph of an old worn brick building. The structure is succumbing to extreme atmospheric heat, with the brickwork and ornate stone details visibly softening and sagging. Intense heat haze and shimmering air distortion. Grounded and epic aesthetic, 8k. Avoid any unnatural looking shapes or effects

## Hero Image 4: Mechanical Cells
**Prompt:** A swarm of small, metallic, globular mechanical cells gathering and self-assembling on the shore of a dark, still lake. 
The cells are forming complex, geometric structures that contrast with the organic reeds and dark water. 
The bright firey Moon glows like a 2nd sun in the sky
Eerie, technological growth in a natural setting, cinematic lighting, 8k.

## Additional/Alternate Shots (Story Context: Fire Cities Being Formed)

### Shot: The Consolidation
**Prompt:** Tall, three-legged **Striders** (Wellsian tripods) dragging massive power cables, transformers, and fuel tanks into a central location. The structures pile up into a towering nest of stolen energy, crackling with arcs of electricity. The beginning of a Fire City. (Visualizes the machines' relentless consolidation of Earth's energy resources.)

### Shot: Wuxing Warfare
**Prompt:** Earth and **Metal Synanthropes** (if visible) standing against **Striders**, their elemental energies clashing. Earth element creates barriers, Metal element refracts heat, but they are slowly overwhelmed. (Reflects the Wuxing causality: Fire defeats Metal, Metal defeats Wood, Earth restrains Fire.)

### Shot: The Hermes vs Rahu
**Prompt:** A massive capital flagship, the *Hermes*, plunging through a field of lunar debris to engage a figure of living fire (Rahu) on the moon's surface. The ship's weapons are firing, and Rahu is blasting back with intense thermal energy. Epic, world-shaking scale.

### Shot: Tor's Sacrifice
**Prompt:** Inside the bridge of the *Hermes*, General Tor stands at the command console as the ship descends toward a fatal impact. The bridge is filled with fire and debris, but he remains calm and stoic, fulfilling his duty. (Tor's final moment before the crash.)
