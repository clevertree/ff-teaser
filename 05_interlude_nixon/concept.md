# Section Concept: 05_interlude_nixon
**Timing:** 2:40 - 3:23

*Note: The first four lines of the Nixon speech (marked [CUT] below) are skipped in this teaser.*

[Interlude: Richard Nixon]
[CUT] Hello, Neil and Buzz
[CUT] I'm talking to you by telephone from the Oval Room at the White House, and this certainly has to be the most historic telephone call ever made from the White House
[CUT] I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you have done
[CUT] For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives
[02:40.00] Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world
[03:00.00] And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth

## Visual Ideas
- **02:40 - Heavens become a part of man's world:** Shot from Earth looking up. The sky plasma (from the Moon's destruction) is rapidly being covered up by a heavy, dark smog that spreads across the entire sky, choking out the light.
- **03:00 - Sea of Tranquility:** Nixon's speech is shown as scrolling text on an old TV screen. The screen is flickering and "going dead" (static, horizontal lines, fading brightness).
- **03:00 - 03:23:** The scene gradually fades to total blackness.
- **03:23:** Music kicks in, transitioning to the fast-cut war sequence in the next section.

03:23-03:35 is when the music comes back in, so the next scene starts at 03:23
