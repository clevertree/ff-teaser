## Hero Image 1: Smog Sky

## Hero Image 2: Dying TV Screen close up
**Prompt:** An old 1960s television close up to the camera. The screen is flickering with static and horizontal lines, showing scrolling text of a speech. The image is fading to black.

## Additional/Alternate Shots (Story Context: The Decade of Revelation Ends)

### Shot: The Media Flood
**Prompt:** Multiple TV screens, computer monitors, and newspapers overlapping and chaotic. Headlines about "Aliens," "Prophecies," "Government Cover-Up," and "Vessels" flicker and scroll. The viewer is overwhelmed by conflicting information. (Visualizes how the truth was lost in a sea of noise.)

### Shot: Rahu's Exposure
**Prompt:** A Vessel (Rahu) standing before a crowd of people, gesturing desperately as his words are drowned out by sirens and alarm broadcasts. His face is twisted in anguish. The crowd turns away, confused. (Captures the moment the Vessels' rebellion fails to reach the public.)

**Prompt:** A computer screen showing cascading error messages and black screens as an invisible electromagnetic pulse washes over the city. Lights flicker and die. Digital records vanish in an instant. (Visualizes the "Great Fry" that erases humanity's history.)

### Shot: The New Chronology Books
**Prompt:** A close-up of a stack of freshly printed history books, titled *The New Chronology*. The dates inside show 102X for the Moon Cataclysm. A hand in a clean Archivist uniform is placing them on a shelf. (The creation of the Thousand-Year Fallacy.)

### Shot: Rahu Propaganda (The Traitor)
**Prompt:** A flickering digital billboard from 202X showing Rahu's face with the word "TRAITOR" or "VILLAIN" stamped over it. The text claims he is an alien agent. (Propaganda used to discredit Rahu's warnings.)
