## Hero Image 1: Extinguishing Stars
**Prompt:** A view from the ground looking at the horizon. A heavy smoke sky spreading across a clear part of the Sky. As the smog advances, the stars in the night sky are extinguished one by one.

## Hero Image 2: Lightning Storm
**Prompt:** Violent lightning arcing across a pitch-black sky, striking buildings, mountains, and trees on the ground. Intense flashes of light in total darkness.

## Additional/Alternate Shots (Story Context: The Thousand-Year Fallacy & Digital Erasure)

### Shot: Books vs. Burned Digital Devices
**Prompt:** A survivor holding weathered physical books, their pages yellowed and worn, while around them smolder the blackened, fried ruins of computers and servers. The books are humanity's last link to the past. (Visualizes why physical records become the "truth" after the Great Fry.)

### Shot: The Smog's Victory
**Prompt:** A timeline showing the sky progressively darkening as smog accumulates. In the first frame, stars are visible. By the last frame, complete darkness except for the distant glow of Fire Cities. (Shows the creeping environmental collapse.)

### Shot: The Archivist Citadel & Striders
**Prompt:** A massive, alien-looking **Archivist Citadel** (Synodic grown) towers over a ruined city. Beneath it, high-speed **Striders** (Wellsian tripods with articulated hoods and thin legs) patrol the streets. They are elegant, terrifying, and efficient.

### Shot: Gorgon Awakening
**Prompt:** A massive, multi-armed metallic **Gorgon** head rising from its incubation nest. Its heat-ray glows softly in the darkness. It is preparing to pilot its **Strider** chassis through the ruins. Indifferent, highly intelligent, pursuing preprogrammed routines.
