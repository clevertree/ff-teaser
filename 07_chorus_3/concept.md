**Timing:** 4:10 - 4:41

## Lyrics Context
- Stars die
- Blinding skies

## Visual Ideas
- **04:10 - Stars Die:** A shot of the heavy smoke sky spreading across a part of the Earth that has yet to be affected. As the smog advances, the stars in the night sky are extinguished one by one.
- **04:20 - Blinding Skies:** Lightning arcs violently across the now-dark sky, striking at any exposed targets on the ground—buildings, mountains, trees, and any remaining lifeforms.
- Final crescendo of the dying stars theme.
- Maximum visual intensity before the fade out.
