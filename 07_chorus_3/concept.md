**Timing:** 4:10 - 4:41

## Lyrics Context
- Stars die
- Blinding skies

## Visual Ideas
- **04:10 - Stars Die:** A shot of the heavy **Synodic Smog** spreading across the Earth. As the industrial-biological clouds advance, the stars in the night sky are extinguished one by one.
- **04:20 - Blinding Skies:** Lightning arcs violently across the now-dark sky from the **Lunar Capacitor's** residual energy.
- **The Archivist Citadel:** A massive, alien-looking structure (Synodic grown) towers over a ruined city. It is clinical, elegant, and terrifyingly efficient.
- **Sequence: The Failure:**
    - Rahu's face flickering in a localized digital panic.
    - The thermal incinerating flash of Rahu's remote detonation at Cradle Zero.
- **Lem's Face:** A final shot of Lem—reset, adolescent, and appearing "ordinary" once more—looking up at the smog-filled sky with an expression of blank realization.
- Final crescendo of the dying stars theme as the world transitions into the **Thousand-Year Fallacy**.
- Maximum visual intensity before the fade out.
